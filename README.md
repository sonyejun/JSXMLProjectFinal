# JS/XMLProject Final

This project allows users to check their location's address and weather based on their latitude and longitude. Additionally, it provides a list of nearby attractions within a 1km radius. Clicking on an attraction in the list automatically opens a new window to Google search for more detailed information. A loading indicator appears until the API communication is complete. Once the communication is finished and the data is displayed, the loading indicator disappears.
